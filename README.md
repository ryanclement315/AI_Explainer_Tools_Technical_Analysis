# DSC 250 Final Project
 
## Files

```experiments.ipynb``` - contains all of our code for running and plotting the experiments in our submission.

```load_dataset.py``` - contains the code used to load and preprocess the two datasets we used.

## Data

The datasets we used are too large to include on GitHub. Therefore, in order to reproduce our results, one must first download the datasets and include them in the appropriate locations within the directory. 

1. Download the [UCI Adult dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult), unzip it, and place the ```adult.data``` file within the folder ```./data/adult```.
2. Download the [Boston Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/prasadperera/the-boston-housing-dataset?select=housing.csv) and place the ```housing.csv``` file within the folder ```./data/```.

Once steps 1 and 2 are completed, all of the code in the repository should run without issues.
